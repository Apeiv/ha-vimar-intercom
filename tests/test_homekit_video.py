"""Direct video from the door panel to the phone, with real SRTP and sockets.

Through ffmpeg, the opening keyframe reached the phone inside a burst with a
presentation time already in the past, and the phone dropped it: two and a
half seconds of black until the next natural keyframe. These tests check that
what we send is a consistent RTP stream (continuous sequence, initial group
squeezed in time, live stream continuing at its own rate) and that the phone
can decrypt it packet by packet.
