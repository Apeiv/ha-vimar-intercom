"""What the HomeKit doorbell needs from the call's media, on top of media_handler.

The accessory does not go through /av: it sends the panel's own H.264 packets to
the phone (or re-encodes them), and its ffmpeg reads the panel's audio from a
local SDP. This module is the small adapter between that and media_handler:

- the video and audio RTP taps (``rtp_sinks`` on the two protocols);
- the keyframe group to replay to a phone that joins mid-call, built from
  media_handler's own GOP cache, with SPS/PPS added when the panel sent them
  earlier than the group;
- one local audio port and SDP per open view.
