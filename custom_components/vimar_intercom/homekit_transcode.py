"""Video transcoded on the Pi: smoother, at a cost of a few tenths of a second.

Direct video delivers the panel packets to the phone as they arrive from the
relay. When the relay loses one (it happens, two or three in a hundred), the
phone can no longer rebuild the picture. It freezes, asks for a keyframe that
the panel ignores, and waits for the panel's next one, up to three seconds.
Measured on 26 September: 13 keyframe requests in one view with a car passing
by, and all losses upstream, none on the Wi-Fi.

Here ffmpeg decodes the panel video. It conceals a lost packet (a brief smear
shows, but the picture keeps moving) and re-encodes with a keyframe every
second: the worst the phone sees is one second, not three. It costs some CPU
(320x240 is nothing for a Pi 5) and a few tens of milliseconds.

One transcoder per call, shared by all views. It starts with the call (or with
the ring, when early media is available), and every view that opens reads
from a stream that is already warm. media_handler's video protocol is one per
hub, reused by every call, so "this call's" transcoder is told apart by the
accessory's call generation, not by the protocol it reads.
